"Help!  Brazil is chasing me!  England, get in here and take the Falklands back!"		
isitchristmas has taken deeply political stances with its flag choices

all the flags stuck to the top of screen cuz of tabs open		
"yep, they just leave the tab open"		
parasites!		
im sure node can handle it		
hmm wonder why it says undefined		
the say() function doesn't return anything		
"I originally had it return the text you type in, but then you see your own text 3 times in a row, kinda jarring"		
is chrome forced to show the say('blah') everytime you type?		
"If someone's scripting incredibly rapid clicks, please stop"		
the network is under a lot of stress today		
can only peoplewith console open see the chat		
I enjoy this site. A lot.		
"What's the dot, the white dot that moves around"		
"Admin, speak"		
"yeah, only people with the console open can see"		
I think the white dot is a bug where you or someone else doesn't have a flag loaded properly		
"I've never seen it myself, others have reported it"		
"Golda, thank you :)"		
hello?		
hi		
What's the weather like over there?		
tht's nice		
"a flag, come at me bro"		
u so nice		
"i typed it, so no"		
hey - please stop		
geez		
network holding up okay out there?		
I'm gonna have to shut off the chat if this keeps up		
"you're bogging down the system for everyone, stop"		
I'm about to disable chat		
This is cool		
A bit strange though.		
"welcome to the future, I suppose"		
hehe		
it's turing-equivalent! you can't stop it!!		
Merry Christmas!

hello!		
Hi		
Hi		
Hi everyone!		
CHRISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTMAS!!!!!!!		
YO!		
it's heeerrreeeee (almoooooost)		
Javascript		
WHAAAAAAAAT'S THAAAAAAT SET OF NUMBERS DOOOIIINNNNGG		
merry xmas		
"Getting weird pauses here, not sure if it is my connection or the server failing."		
Javascript		
COUNT MY FINGERS 'TIL EXTINCTION		
Happy holidays dudes		
konklone: What are you using redis and mongo for in this app?		
"The numbers are there so each message is different, and therefore is not blocked by the server."		
haha the hell		
"Redis is for tracking analytics on visitors (browsers/os/version/websockets), and for keeping central record of who's connected"		
also for sending chat messages and other commands that affect all servers at once		
it 'scales' just by having tons of servers operating in parallel in their own separate mouse universes		
and mongo?		
Mongo is just what I chose to use to store mappings of IP blocks to country codes		
in past years I used a SQL dump from hostip.info		
this time I'm using a spreadsheet so I loaded it into whatever I felt like		
yep		
is there more than 1 server?		
"Right now, there's 25 doing the streaming - I had it on 35 for a while but just dropped it down to make the rooms fuller"		
BRO		
"there's also 25 doing the main website, which does the country code lookup and gets out of the way"		
these are pretty weak servers - 256MB VMs		
Good work. I'm impressed		
Angus - it's real easy to DOS me		
you dont need decent servers for this anyway. pretty cool though		
Angus - please don't		
thank you		
See?		
"Shandi - yeah, you don't need decent servers to handle one room's worth"		
"But right now there are 1,292 people connected, and that needs to get spread out"		
"It seems like each weak server can hold 50-60 people, including idle folks"		
i see. isn't there a timeout?		
"yeah, I close out people who closed the tab - but lots of people just leave it in their tab forest"		
Or walk away		
Doing christmassy things		
what time zone is Mars anyway		
Have a timer to log them out after 180 seconds of inactivity.		
"Angus - I thought about that, but then you lose the ability to leave it open for ambient enjoyment, like projecting onto a wall or whatever"		
hi there		
"minus a couple of years, GMT"		
"Anyway, they're not a drain, idle people aren't the problem - I just mean that it only takes like 30 people's active mice to sap one server - next year I'll go for beefier ones"		
Hello from Canada!		
"though then client limits will be more important, and people's browsers will clog after so many people - and so I'll need to do room management in the application layer - which is no fun :)"		
hi Kristin!		
Will it ever be christmas?		
very cool that this was done with Sockets/Node. will be checking this out on github.		
this is kewl		
V8 and TCP are just crazy fast		
nice		
"But actually I might try to do something crazier, like connecting people's browsers directly to some blind ZeroMQ thing for high-throughput stuff like mouse movement"		
cause the mouse movement is actually a bottleneck even with how fast Node is - I'm still doing a stupid for loop to send out every x/y coords to every person		
nice		
Do you check to make sure they've changed since the last movement first?		
I really need to change my mindset about these kind of things. I'm still stuck in pre-ajax ways. And now we have sockets. Which is around for a year? two? Crazy		
"Angus - no need, the browser doesn't send the move event at all unless the coords change"		
@mfirdaus - this is my first time doing anything like it		
"Oh, yeah, I remember. I've been working on a game for a long time that requires mouse movement checking."		
"the network feels clogged - I'm going to add a bunch of servers - when it's done (~5 mins) it'll dis/reconnect everyone and shuffle rooms, but chat goes across everything"		
Who is your host?		
foo		
bar		
indeed.		
I'm on Nodejitsu		
"*in old man voice* Are you using iframes? or maybe them new fangled aye, jacks?"		
epic chat latency up in here		
Thanks. I've never heard of them before.		
they've got awesome support and have been a huge help today and over the past 6 weeks.		
Thanks. I might go check them out.		
Good luck! Gotta go.		
Have a good night		
merry christmas :)		
"Hera - yeah, I'm adding servers"		
"Ha, this is deadly"		
you'll get reconnected in a few minutes and hopefully it'll be better after that		
"Happy christmas, friends :)"		
Hello		
Merry Christmas from Dublin Everyone. Great job on this node app btw!		
What's up		
hello		
Merry xmas!		
yo		
thanks doktor :)		
Hi		
hopefully lag will be lower now :)		
I'll probably bump 'em up a few more times as we climb towards midnight on the east coast		
"so, lets say I'm starting from scratch with no servers that support node.js. What'd be the cost to support the load that you're handling?"		
halp		
woah		
HEY		
hey		
well what's goin on in this thing		
whaaat		
So....		
Well this is pretty cool.		
hey playas		
"It depends, I guess? This load is unusually high because of the live mouse streaming. It's $3/256MB server/month, and I'm using 60 of them right now, but for just a couple of days"		
it's a ~secret chat~		
it is pretty cool		
"oops, renamed"		
2spooky		
~secret eatings~		
... did everyone get here because they wanted to screw around the console?		
i got here to try to remove the flags :V		
yup		
probs could've just set the flags class to display:none	 but that's not as fun	
how the fuck do you even chage your name		
rename('name')		
hey!		
your'e		
I took the names from a CSV from some Princeton intro to CS class		
there you go		
blame the American higher education system		
So what timezone does this christmas depend on		
or is it local		
whats up		
PST is the best time		
Yo!		
what is up alex?		
wtf		
Should be by timezone		
it uses your browser's time		
I'm in the center of the O		
Oh... I've been on the E		
it's actually the most trivial part of the whole system		
4 8 15 16 23 42		
"It's not christmas here yet, I have no E!"		
hello world		
Or he could have an E becuse it's in another language		
"You could've done a single line javascript for this site, but no, you had to overengineer it to involve user interaction"		
oh hi there		
Who's all here from HN?		
how the fffff		
neat guys		
it's magic		
christmas magic		
"I'm amazed anybody is here from HN, it got like 11 points"		
"simple enough, but still neat"		
thanks Luce :)

Christmas in 4~ minutes at GMT-4		
"And here, I guess"		
Im not waiting for christmans bu am waiting for Doctor Who christmas special.		
so chat is still popular :) yahoo chat why did you shutdown		
"@mfirdaus: you keep changing countries, I can't trust your geographic identity"		
... word. I estimate in 18 hours I can watch the special		
this is pretty brillant		
I didn't know that chat is so cool		
konklone: Haha. I only figured out the me object. Probably can't mess with the flag due to serverside		
"Wow, so many americans"		
"http://konklone.com/post/the-making-of-isitchristmas-dot-com-2012 Going to read this explanation now, enjoy"		
[00:00:00.002] Christmas! <- small delay 	D	
why isn't my flag germany?		
"@mfirdaus - actually you're wrong, by changing your country it should change what others see"		
@mfirdaus - it may only work for new people coming in		
Luis: DAMNIT		
i am from germany but mine flag is amerika?		
"Temima - if I got an IP address that doesn't map to any IP block, I default to US"		
ah.  is it possibly to be bant from this site?		
this is pretty cool		
"I should default it to Esperanto, really"		
"Temima - you might be sending some weird IP address to me, like a LAN IP or something, I don't know"		
"also, why is mine name 'Temima'?"		
"in fact, I will"		
"Temima - it picks a random name for you, feel free to change it with rename()"		
"Temima - if you hold on a few minutes, I'll make it so that when you refresh, your flag will be different"		
"if we get enough people, we can block out the message"		
fuck carrots		
can you make mine flag Germany?		
Neat		
Hello		
rename myself to Deutschland now!		
Hello		
Temima - probably not		
wow a chat in console		
incredible		
genius		
Hello!		
Wallah!		
"to speak type ""say(""message"")"" "		
my flag is the biggest. i win		
australia is cool		
"certainly, would put this (chat in console) in random projects. easter egg? hacker-movie like ARG"		
i died from lack of heartbeat.... wat		
"If lots of people are dying from lack of heartbeat, I can up the # of servers"		
then it is the dead of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!		
Easy enough to fix

hey other konklone: mind renaming? :)		
"yeah, this whole thing is pretty vulnerable - I've had to turn off chat for periods of time before, it's nicer when it can stay open"		
"30 minutes til, I hope my code works"		
though i guess irc would be programmable via the client 'n stuff		
Hello!		
Wow that took a while to figure out		
This is charming		
Okedoky		
I love that this is kind of hidden		
"for (  var i = 0; i < 999999; i++ ) { window.removeOther(i); } didn't do at all what i had thought, heh"		
konklone2: thanks :)		
hi		
ho ho ho		
It isn't hidden at all…		
ho ho ho		
"me too, welcome"		
other people there?		
plus I keep telling people about it		
"Yes, mike"		
hi		
We're here		
good job with this		
this is cool		
It's not immediately obvious		
test successful		
anyone else here from /b/		
wheeeee		
there've been a bunch of folks from /b/ in and out tonight :)		
I tried to use /b/		
they sort of make an impression		
I was wondering why so many flags weren't moving - you're in here I guess. :)		
please don't DOS or spam me though!

"T: yeah, I developed it"		
How long have you been doing this?		
"yeah, cpancake."		
"nice job, man."		
Neat		
also why		
thanks :)		
How is jinjitsu? Is it basically Heroku for node.js?		
cause it seemed like a cool idea		
This is trippy		
cool beans		
Come with me... Cupcake.		
"Nodejitsu is a PaaS like Heroku, yeah. Heroku does Node.js too, though they don't support native WebSockets"		
it'd be fun if you added sound effects...		
"You don't need WebSockets to do most things, you can do chat rooms and stuff, even Etherpad, using polling"		
Hi!		
"but for real time mouse motion, you need streaming"		
	o	
Good to know Heroku can't do websockets… especially since I detest polling :P		
"Yea, Heroku couldn't last time I tried."		
my god		
"It's unfortunate they don't, it's definitely part of the future"		
Probably a security issue		
"yup, it's pretty annoying how many cloud hosts don't support websockets"		
adf		
Maybe the build pack could be modified to support it or something?		
whaaaaat		
omg		
whaaat		
"T: not sure of Heroku's infrastructure, but I suspect their proxies drop WS packets"		
quick question: what do you use redis and mongo for?		
"Redis is for storing analytics and storing enough to show me a dashboard across servers - also I use its pub/sub for this chat room, and for other commands"		
Mongo is what I use to do the lookups of IP address -> country code		
wtf		
Hi blk!		
How well does redis' pubsub scale?		
"konklone: yeah, that'd be a problem I guess"		
Who the fuck uses MongoDB? What's wrong with you?		
"ah, nice. thanks!"		
"I'm gonna bump up the servers, we'll all experience a reconnect in a few minutes, it should be smoother after that"		
I hate you for using MongoDB.		
FP: Sorry that this is such a charged personal issue for you		
you're trolling... right?		
To be sure.		
It's the FINAL COUNTDOWN: 0		
What is wrong with MongoDB?		
Andrew: I know you		
everything		
that is a catchphrase		
I won't tell		
NoSQL is a bad idea		
konklone- wut?		
Well then attack NoSQL rather than MongoDB		
"Andrew: oh, maybe not"		
ok good point		
nosql is dumb		
There's nothing wrong with NoSQL		
you can choose to be anyone on the interbet.  Why why hell would you choose to be stupid?		
I have a friend named Andrew who uses 'To be sure.' all the time		
HEy i dont like it u jerk		
hmm		
reddit army is here		
I don't think I say it very much myself.		
"FP: respectfully, nosql has done a lot for me in my work and personal life and it causes me no great pain :)"		
what hi who is impersonating me and why		
"it gets the job done well, that's all I can really say"		
<3 u though		
"okay, you convinced me"		
No we need a way to ban people from the JS console...		
Data is not always relational		
Helo		
Progress!		
nosql is nice for things that don't require complex queries		
u convinced me		
Is there an ignore function?		
myg0t army is here		
yes type window.close()		
Thank you FP :)

It's pretty depressing when you spell English better than native speakers :\

"trying to bring up more servers but they've been erroring out, so I've got the 30 I've got"

Yay :D		
"don't refresh the page - the main app is down right now, am working on it"		
"but the streaming app works, so we can still chat"		
You have servers dedicated to the streaming?		
I think it was just a huge rush of traffic		
"yeah, it's split into two"		
"that's designed so that if the streaming app goes down, the main app still works - it wasn't designed for the opposite case :)"		
Horray for semi-redundancy.		
"Of course, scaling"		
The main app kind of sets up the connection to the streaming app so that makes sense		
"When you change flags, the old ones remain on screen"		
"Looks like a model UN on my screen right now, lol"		
setCursor()		
Yes-- I did that	 it changed the flag but the old flag remains drawn on the screen in a fixed position	
Oh that explains it		
I just assumed someone else changed to Uzbek and there was another Canadian aboat		
Hehe		
man this is kinda depressing - the midnight rush just killed it		
"Can you distribute it to multiple servers? I feel silly for asking, but I'm dumb with programming stuff."		
it is distributed to multiple servers

Nodejitsu doesn't scale too well		
I tried to get websockets to work on my personal Web server for weeks. :[

Anyone know of another node host that supports websockets?		
I am now putting node.js and websocket on my resume.		
Raphie: besides nodejitsu?

"apparently, it works"		
or this all is a very deliberate setup		
None of this is real.		
it works		
and is awesome		
"The world ended on Friday, as was foretold."		
"hmm, for some time there was only my flag in the page, and apparently you were both here too"		
so it limits / shards the participants somehow?		
i wish i knew enough to know how this works		
No one knows. This is basically witchcraft.		
Hi		
Everyone ignore Matt. He's probably a jerk.		
"interesting, is it possible to change country"		
"Well, I guess that's true :("		
"I'm sorry, Matt. I didn't mean it."		
I'm glad he put in the flag thing in the top right. Some of the flags I've seen today totally threw me off.		
Like Canada. Who knew they were a country?		
omg this is awesome		
Don't give them any ideas.		
"I like you Matt, don't worry"		
Euclid: it does shard the rooms

Flagmaster: speak for yourself

haha		
this is so weird		
what is the point?!?!		
I blame the Egg Nog.		
"YES in Spanish translates to And is', am I right?"		
"lots of disconnects, sadly"		
for americans to exert their christmas knowledge dominance from the look of it		
why am I a canadian		
"flagmaster, are there any stats about current system load?"		
I dont see any canadians		
sophie: why not?		
what are the bottlenecks of the system? redis?		
sim		
waving your mouse around manically makes the system load better I heard		
I'm not actually the official Flagmaster.		
I'm just kind og drunk and lonely.

I'm waiting to pick a fight with Madagascar.

Watching a bunch of US flags chase around a Japanese flag is quite amusing.		
"I'm Madagascar, look at how manay species of lemur I have!"		
"okay, let's program some motion"		
aw man I just found this part!

with setInterval you can say the same thing every three seconds.		
oh great		
Hello		
loopdeloop		
"Too bad this wasn't like IRC, where people could just be kicked."		
/me tells konklone		
You can also stop saying it with clearInterval

what are the parameters for setInterval		
"鈴木: where you at, bro? tokyo here! \o/"		
"setInterval(function() { say(""whatever"") }, 3000)"		
"Hold down the power button on your computer for 10 seconds, it will list all the parameters."

Please close your browser tab and come back		
You can actually clear the interval		
The console should have printed an integer when you called setInterval		
Rando -- oh cool. how?		
ABORT! ABORT!		
You can call setInterval with that integer as the only param		
I mean clearInterval		
My mistake		
what?		
"For some reason, I keep reading 'Rando' as 'Rambo' :/"		
hey all		
hahahahah		
how's it been? I've been only half-around the last hour and a half or so		
It shall be done.		
merry christmas everyone

"It basically does what say() does, except with a hack"		
lol		
Where is sendraw defined?		
global		
Not defined in my version		
wow I should learn some web dev or something		
JS the good parts is a good place to start		
Is it in the page source? I couldn't find it with a search.		
"ok I set it to say it every minute, happy?"		
"Hm, I'm wondering where sendRaw went. Maybe I got the name confused."		
You can look at the source at https://github.com/isitchristmas		
"Been looking for a way to inject some JS for all connected clients, but I'm not seeing it yet. It appears the only thing that happens with the message is it gets sent to console.log"		
"sorry, it's called rawSend"		
Merry X-Mas		
I wish everyone was connected on one screen		
Hey all		
hi		
how did you all find out about this		
"So tom, how do you inject JS? From what I've seen, it just goes to console.log. (Sorry if you already said. I had to disconnect for a bit.)"		
good morning		
what is happening oh gosh		
"hi, guys!"		
"I don't provide a way of injecting raw JavaScript, to my knowledge"		
Damn.. I just looked at the source code.. and saw this..		
"It's easy to fake events from clients, but the only things that are really destructive to other users have to be sent down from the server, under my control"		
interesting		
Hello everyone		
why am i coming up in the US		
lol		
you likke that y...................yesssssssssssssssssssssssss		
"hey konklone, what should it say on Oct 31?"		
I just have it saying Oct 31 = Dec 25 for now…		
that joke is so old oh my god		
Hey!		
"After I crashed a couple of times tonight on the new host, I switched to the old host for the main web page, which also switched me to using a less accurate location detector"		
"{""_event"":""command"",""command"":""refresh""}"		
"Yeah, it incorrectly says I'm from the US =("		
I head you crashed hahahaha		
"No, indeed you're right. There is no XSS available as far as I can tell. Well done!"		
Seems safe enough		
Justin: You can use a greasemonkey script to set your country to whatever you want :)		
but of course names are not reserved :)		
"Umm.. Okay, lol"		
:P		
I didn't expect to find this little gem		
it's a bit deeper than unreserved names. You can just inject arbitrary messages to the client side		
I just pressed Ctrl+U and started reading.. And got an Xmas message!		
Close your browser?		
@tom: How so? I'm still not seeing the exploit.		
Haha.		
:D		
konklone: I'll send a pull req when I wake up		
"I mean, yeah, you can send any message *to the server*, but that's true for any websockets app."		
ssss		
hallo		
Hi.		
"Hey, have you ever talked to yourself before?"		
It doesn't look like the server 'trusts' the message for anything important. And I don't think you can broadcast an arbitrary message to other clients.		
the server is much more locked down than the client		
Exactly.		
"you can try to send it up the kinds of messages that it can send down to clients, but it won't pass them on"		
the server sends commands like refresh and reconnect in response to me publishing a string to a redis channel		
Nice		
konklone: How many unique hits have you had on this? :o		
eskimo is impressed		
I'm gonna have to sign off in a sec and go to bed		
Man who spread joy to many web devs in world	 is on Santa good list for sure	
"Hey konklone, thanks for the awesome post on how you made this. I was really informed and impressed."		
"12/24 had 167K uniques, 12/25 so far (3.5 hours) has 35K uniques"		
"Matt: awesome, glad you liked it"		
Nice		
its christmas		
"So, how much do you like it? Would you blow me?"		
Nice!		
Let me check		
he's impersonating me		
Yes		
nice		
*eye roll*		
"no, he's the impostor. not I"		
You can't tell which one of us is the real konklone!		
why does the client keep track of the names		
I blew a nigerian scammer? Nice		
Justin: haha		
what is this madness?		
I'm travelling the Universe right now		
"okay: real konklone, signing off to go to bed and wake up in ~4 hours for opening presents"		
night all!		
where would I learn all this cool js stuff		
Nite :)		
why reinvent irc		
"Good night, man! Thanks for such an awesome site"		
Err:508		
don't be a hater!		
This is awesome :)

"im from japan, but it says [US]"		
hey

lol		
oh. we zalgo now		
clear		
guys do you see that all flags are in the left top?		
the flags are really lagging for me		
same		
do you see flags in the top left?		
nope		
Merry Christmas people!		
anyone here?		
Yep!		
do you guys see flags in the top?		
aligned		
This seems to think i'm in the US - even though what says United Kingdom in the top right!		
I don't think so...		
Spain ftw		
meow		
"Dexter, yep, still shows me as a US flag"		
Weird.		
anyone here knows JS?		
"yes, ish"		
"I keep trying something, but it isn't working"		
we're using the console right?		
yes		
but that's just a basic command		
"I mean, how else are we chatting?"		
* function call		
So you know some JS or not?		
Of course		
I am trying to move other flags		
But I'm busy chasing rep on stackoverflow		
Can you help me?		
"It works in another tab, but I'm not sure whether people are seeing it"		
:-(		
pretty sure there's different mouse rooms or whatever		
I've got this so far		
a new websockets connects gives you a new room		
Oh		
"var posx = 45; for (var x in others) { rawSend(JSON.stringify({ _event: ""motion"", c: others[x].country, id: x, x: posx, y: 20})); posx += 45; }"		
my 'room' id is 'nDE2aVPW5ap5ZBKL'		
can you run that for me		
check your network frames		
wss://iic_sockets.jit.su/christmas/195/kt0nzjml/websocket is the one I'm currently connected to apparently		
where do you see that?		
"Happy Christmas, guys :)"		
network tab... you're using google chrome right?		
yes		
ah got it under websockets		
foo		
let me poke it on github		
just ignore this		
"hey look, it stopped"		
why my flag is wrong?		
"I have no clue, why is your flag wrong?"		
I'm unproundly from italy but my flag is chile's fla
