### isitchristmas data

Data from running isitchristmas.com.

#### Google Analytics

Some Google Analytics traffic reports from:

* 2007
* 2008
* 2009
* 2010
* 2011
* 2011
* 2012
* 2013

#### 2012

In 2012, there was a [weird flag experiment](https://konklone.com/post/isitchristmas-dot-com-2012) on isitchristmas.com. From it, I have three data files:

* [countries.csv](2012/countries.csv) - Connection counts from countries around the world. Unlike Google Analytics, this represents **successful connections** to the streaming server, not visitors to the website.
* [browsers.csv](2012/browsers.csv) - Stats on connections from different browsers. How many connections from each browser, and what "transport" they used (Websockets, XHR streaming, XDR streaming).
* [chat.csv](2012/chat.csv) - The "secret" dev console chat room. It's been cleaned of spam and ugly things, at my sole and capricious discretion.
